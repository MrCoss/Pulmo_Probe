## Project Overview

The original lung cancer dataset was messy, incomplete, and highly imbalanced. PulmoProbe AI solves this by creating a clean, enriched synthetic dataset with 20M+ records, including:

* **Clinical Features:** Tumor biomarkers, cancer stage, metastasis sites, treatment cycles and durations.
* **Lifestyle & Environment:** Smoking exposure, BMI categories, air quality indices.
* **Derived Features:** Standardized and normalized metrics for enhanced predictive performance.

The enriched dataset enables scalable ML pipelines using Logistic Regression (SGD), HistGradientBoosting, and XGBoost models, capable of efficiently processing massive datasets.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind CSS – responsive, fast, and modern UI.
* **Backend:** FastAPI + Docker – secure, containerized API services.
* **Model Hosting:** Hugging Face Spaces for scalable AI inference.
* **Deployment:** Vercel for global, low-latency performance.

## Key Features

* **Scalable ML:** Handles 20M+ records with memory-efficient chunked processing.
* **Feature Engineering:** Clinical and synthetic features enhance predictive accuracy.
* **Model Evaluation:** Performance metrics include Accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score.
* **Visualization & EDA:** Interactive exploration of data distributions and survival patterns.
* **Educational & Research Focus:** Demonstrates AI applications in healthcare.
